\section{Simplicial sets}
\begin{definition}
    Usually denoted by $\Delta$, the simplex category or the simplicial category is the category with linearly ordered sets $[n]=\{0,1,2,\cdots ,n\}$ as its objects and order-preserving maps between them as its morphisms.
    That is, for a map $\varphi:[m] \to [n]$ we have that $0 \leq \varphi(i)\leq \varphi(j)\leq n$ for each $0 \leq i \leq j \leq m$.
\end{definition}
We denote by $\delta^i$ the elementary face operator $[n-1] \to [n]$ and by $\sigma^i$ the elementary degeneracy operator $[n+1] \to [n]$ given by
\[
    \begin{aligned}
        \delta^i(j) =
        \begin{cases}
            j   & \text{ if } j < i    \\
            j+1 & \text{ if } j \geq i
        \end{cases}, \quad
        \sigma^i(j) =
        \begin{cases}
            j   & \text{ if } j \leq i \\
            j-1 & \text{ if } j > i
        \end{cases}
    \end{aligned}
\]
\begin{remark}
    All morphisms in $\Delta$ are compositions of such morphisms.
\end{remark}
\begin{definition}
    We define the category $\sset$ of simplicial sets as $\SET$-valued presheaves on $\Delta$.
\end{definition}
Let $X \in \sset : = \Fun(\Delta^{op}, \SET)$. We wil denote by $X_n$ the set $X([n])$ of $n$-simplices in $X$.
We define the standard $n$-simplex as $\Delta^n:=y([n])$ where $y$ is the Yoneda embedding, meaning $\Delta^n$ is the presheaf $\Hom_{\Delta}(\blank,[n])$.
By the Yoneda lemma $\Hom_{\Fun(\Delta^{op}, \SET)}(\Delta^n, X) \simeq X_n$, so we can identify each simplex $x\in X_n$ with a map $x:\Delta^n\to X$.
This application of the Yoneda lemma is a crucial part of the theory of simplicial sets and we will more often than not consider $n$-simplices of a simplicial set $X$ as maps of simplicial sets instead.
Observe, moreover that composition with the elementary face operator gives us a map $\Delta^{n-1}\to\Delta^n$.
%by $\delta^i \circ\blank$.
\begin{definition}
    For a simplicial set $X$, we define the face and degeneracy maps
    \[
        d_i: = X(\delta^i): X_{n} \to X_{n-1}, \quad s_i: = X(\sigma^i): X_{n} \to X_{n+1}
    \]
    where both maps are given by composition with $\delta^i$ and $\sigma^i$ respectively.
\end{definition}
\begin{example}
    The standard $0$-simplex $\Delta^0:=\Hom(\blank, [0])$ is a terminal object in $\sset$, meaning it maps any $[m]\in \Delta$ to a singleton.
\end{example}
\begin{example}[{\cite[\href{https://kerodon.net/tag/000P}{Remark 000P}]{kerodon}}]
    Let $X \in \sset$ and suppose we have subsets $T_n\subseteq X_n$ for every $n\geq 0$ such that $d_i(T_n)\subseteq T_{n-1}$ and $s_i(T_n) \subseteq T_{n+1}$.
    Then the collection $\{T_n\}_{n\geq 0}$ is a simplicial set we will call a simplicial subset $T\subseteq X$.
\end{example}
\begin{definition}
    We define the boundary $\partial\Delta^n$ of $\Delta^n$ as the simplicial set
    \[
        (\partial\Delta^n)_m = (\partial\Delta^n)([m]) :=\{\alpha \in \Hom_{\Delta}([m], [n]) | [n] \not\subseteq \mathrm{im}(\alpha)\}.
    \]
    Observe that $\partial\Delta^0=\emptyset$ because every map $[m] \to [0]$ is surjective.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
    For $0\leq i \leq n$, we define the horn $\Lambda_i^n$ as the simplicial set
    \[
        (\Lambda_i^n)_m =(\Lambda_i^n)([m]) :=\{\alpha \in \Hom_{\Delta}([m], [n]) | \delta^i[n] \not\subseteq \mathrm{im}(\alpha)\}.
    \]
\end{definition}
Observe that the horn is inside the boundary.
We usually refer to $\Lambda_i^n$ as the $i$th horn in $\Delta^n$ and we will call the horns such that $0<i<n$ the inner horns.
\begin{example}
    \TODO{Write about $\mathrm{Sing}(X)$ for a topological space $X$.}
\end{example}
\begin{example}
    We define the nerve $\Nerve(\C)$ of a $1$-category $\C$ by
    \[
        \Nerve(\C) : = \Hom_{\mathrm{Cat}}([\blank], \C)
    \]
    where we view the sets $[n]$ as categories (posets with a map $i$ to $j$ whenever $i\leq j$).
    Observe that for any order-preserving morphism $\alpha : [m] \to [n]$ we get a map
    \[
        \Hom_{\mathrm{Cat}}([n], \C) \xrightarrow{\blank \circ \alpha} \Hom_{\mathrm{Cat}}([m], \C)
    \]
    and it is clear that the nerve is a simplicial set with $\Nerve(\C)_n = \Hom_{\mathrm{Cat}}([n], \C)$.
\end{example}
\section{$\infty$-categories}
What Joyal \cite{Joyal} named quasi-categories and Lurie \cite{HTT} calls $\infty$-categories were originally called weak Kan complexes by Boardman and Vogt \cite{BoardmanVogt}.
As most of this thesis follows Lurie's works very closely, we will follow his convention and use the name $\infty$-categories.
Before we give a precise definition, we will take a closer look at the nerve construction.
Clearly, we want the nerve of a $1$-category to give us an $\infty$-category and most of this thesis will revolve around nerves of certain poset-categories of topological spaces.
Nerves of categories are not just any ordinary simplicial sets, but simplicial sets with some more structure inherited from the underlying $1$-category.
For instance, $1$-categories have composition of morphisms.
Take for example
\[\begin{tikzcd}
        X && Y \\
        & Z
        \arrow["f", from=1-1, to=1-3]
        \arrow["g", from=1-3, to=2-2]
        %\arrow["h"', from=1-1, to=2-2]
    \end{tikzcd}\]
in some ordinary $1$-category $\C$.
This diagram gives us a morphism $\Lambda_1^2\to \Nerve(\C)$ of simplicial sets, but in $\C$ $f$ and $g$ can be composed to a morphism $h: X \to Z$ which in turn gives a unique way to extend the simplicial map $\Lambda_1^2\to \Nerve(\C)$ to a map $\Delta^2 \to \Nerve(\C)$.
If we instead look at the outer horns $\Lambda_0^2$ and $\Lambda_2^2$ we will not necessarily have a way to extend morphisms to $\Delta^2$ in general.
For example the diagram
\[\begin{tikzcd}
        X && Y \\
        & X
        \arrow["g", from=1-3, to=2-2]
        \arrow["\id_X"', from=1-1, to=2-2]
    \end{tikzcd}\]
gives a map $\Lambda_2^2\to \Nerve(\C)$, but extending this to a morphism $\Delta^2 \to \Nerve(\C)$ would amount to finding a right-inverse to $g$, which of course is not something we can always do in general, unless $\C$ was a groupoid.
This property of extending a morphism from a horn to the standard $n$-simplex is sometimes also called filling the horn, and we will see that it is a defininig property for $\infty$-categories.
In fact, the existence of horn fillings completely classifies the simplicial sets which are nerves of categories:
\begin{proposition}[{\cite[Proposition 1.1.2.2]{HTT}}]
    Let $X \in \sset$.
    Then the following conditions are equivalent:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item There exists a small category $\C$ with an isomorphism $X \simeq \Nerve(\C)$.
        \item Every inner horn $\Lambda_i^n \to X$ of $X$ can be filled in an unique way.
              Or, in other words, for any solid diagram as below, there is a unique dotted arrow making it commute:
              \[\begin{tikzcd}
                      {\Lambda_i^n} && X \\
                      \\
                      {\Delta^n}
                      \arrow[from=1-1, to=1-3]
                      \arrow[from=1-1, to=3-1]
                      \arrow["{\exists!}"', dashed, from=3-1, to=1-3]
                  \end{tikzcd}\]
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}
Simplicial sets which admits extensions for all horn are called Kan complexes:
\begin{definition}
    A simplicial set $X$ is a Kan complex if it satisfies the following condition:
    For $0 \leq i \leq n$, any map $\sigma_0 : \Lambda_i^n \to X$ can be extended to a map $\sigma: \Delta^n \to X$.
\end{definition}
As we saw in the example of a map $\Lambda_2^2\to \Nerve(\C)$ above, whenever there's non-invertible morphisms around some outer horns will be impossible to fill.
This motivates the definition of an $\infty$-category.
The following definition is due to Boardman and Vogt \cite{BoardmanVogt} who defined weak Kan complexes as simplicial sets satisfying what they called the restricted Kan condition:
\footnote{Maybe more commonly known as the weak Kan extension condition. Expand on this with a historical account.}:
\begin{definition}[Boardman and Vogt \cite{BoardmanVogt}]
    A simplicial set $X$ is an $\infty$-category if it satisfies the following condition:
    For $0 < i < n$, any map $\sigma_0 : \Lambda_i^n \to X$ can be extended to a map $\sigma: \Delta^n \to X$.
\end{definition}

This means that any Kan complex is an $\infty$-category, and in particular so is $\mathrm{Sing}(X)$ for a topological space $X$.
Additionally, observe that the nerve $\Nerve(\C)$ of an ordinary category $\C$ is an $\infty$-category.
Because the nerve functor is fully faithful, many authors choose to omit its notation altogether.
\TODO{Write fully-faithfulness of the nerve as a proposition or something.}
\prepp{Consider if we should omit it as well. Currently we have been using it, but it is fucking annoying to remember writing $\Nerve$ all the time.}
In many ways $\infty$-categories behave similarly to ordinary categories and we will often write about them almost as if they were ordinary categories instead.
For example, we will use the terminology of ordinary category theory and refer to the vertices and edges of our simplicial sets as objects and morphism in our $\infty$-categories.
There are however some obvious differences between ordinary categories and $\infty$-categories which needs adressing before adopting complete $1$-categorical language.
For example, and perhaps most crucially, we have higher-level maps given by simplices of dimension $n\geq 2$.
\TODO{Write about $\MAP$.}
While we have seen that nerves of categories admit unique horn extensions, this condition is dropped for general $\infty$-categories and hence, composition of morphisms in an $\infty$-category are not necessarily unique, but rather unique up to homotopy.
Before we can make this precise, we must define what we mean by homotopy.
\subsection{Homotopy}
\begin{definition}[{\cite[\href{https://kerodon.net/tag/003V}{Definition 003V}]{kerodon}}]
    Let $\C$ be an $\infty$-category and $f,g \in \Hom_{\C}(C,D)$.
    We define a homotopy between $f$ and $g$ as a $2$-simplex $\sigma \in \C$ with boundary specified by $d_0(\sigma) = \id_D, d_1(\sigma) = g$ and $d_2(\sigma)=f$ and we say $f$ and $g$ are homotopic if such a homotopy exists.
\end{definition}
\begin{example}
    For a $1$-category $\C$ two morphisms $f,g \in \Hom_{\C}(C,D)$ are homotopic in $\Nerve(\C)$ if and only if $f=g$.
\end{example}
\begin{proposition}[{\cite[\href{https://kerodon.net/tag/003Z}{Proposition 003Z}]{kerodon}}]
    Let $\C$ be an $\infty$-category and $C,D$ objects of $\C$.
    Then homotopy is an equivalence relation on $\Hom_{\C}(C,D)$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    \TODO{Prove. Both Rune and Lurie have nice proofs.}
\end{proof}
\begin{proposition}
    $f,g \in \Hom_{\C}(C,D)$ are homotopic if and only if they are homotopic as morphisms in $\C^{op}$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    \TODO{Lurie.}
\end{proof}
\TODO{Consider adding Corollary \cite[\href{https://kerodon.net/tag/00V0}{Corollary 00V0}]{kerodon}}
Now that we know what it means for morphisms of $\infty$-categories to be homotopic, we can define a composition of morphisms.
\begin{definition}[{\cite[\href{https://kerodon.net/tag/0042}{Definition 0042}]{kerodon}}]
    Let $\C$ be an $\infty$-category with morphisms
    \[\begin{tikzcd}
            X && Y \\
            & Z
            \arrow["f", from=1-1, to=1-3]
            \arrow["g", from=1-3, to=2-2]
            \arrow["h"', from=1-1, to=2-2]
        \end{tikzcd}\]
    We define $h$ to be a composition of $f$ and $g$ if there exists some $2$-simplex $\sigma \in \C$ such that $d_0(\sigma) = g, d_1(\sigma)=h$ and $d_2(\sigma)=f$.
    We say $\sigma$ witnesses $h$ as a composition of $f$ and $g$ and we will use the usual notation $h = g \circ f$.
\end{definition}
Observe that we have only defined composition up to homotopy.
We make this precise in the following proposition:
\begin{proposition}[{\cite[\href{https://kerodon.net/tag/0043}{Proposition 0043}]{kerodon}}]
    Let $\C$ be an $\infty$-category with morphisms $f$ and $g$ as follows:
    \[\begin{tikzcd}
            X && Y \\
            & Z
            \arrow["f", from=1-1, to=1-3]
            \arrow["g", from=1-3, to=2-2]
            \arrow["h"', dashed, from=1-1, to=2-2]
        \end{tikzcd}\]
    Then there exists a composition $h$ of $f$ and $g$ and any other morphism $X\to Z$ is a composition of $f$ and $g$ if and only if it is homotopic to $h$.
\end{proposition}
\prepp{The proof seems kind of technical, so might not be worth doing. Might do it if there's time or Rune thinks I should.
    Should consider adding \cite[\href{https://kerodon.net/tag/000Z}{Exercise 000Z}]{kerodon} as this exercise is used in a lot of the proofs in this subsection.}
Furthermore, compositions respect homotopy in the following sense:
\begin{proposition}[{\cite[\href{https://kerodon.net/tag/0048}{Proposition 0048}]{kerodon}}]
    Let $\C$ be an $\infty$-category with homotopic morphisms $f \sim f':X \to Y$ and $g \sim g': Y \to Z$.
    Let $h=f\circ g$ and $h' = f' \circ g'$.
    Then $h$ is homotopic to $h'$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{remark}
    The nerve construction preserves compositions in the sense that for a $1$-category $\C$ with morphisms $f,g$ as above, there is a unique morphism $h:\Nerve(X)\to \Nerve(Z)$ in $\Nerve(\C)$ which is given by $f\circ g$ in $\C$.
\end{remark}
In a later chapter on Kan extensions we will see that the nerve construction $\Delta \xrightarrow{\Nerve} \C$ admits a left adjoint $\h$ and moreover that the counit of this adjunction is an isomorphism which in turn means that the nerve is fully faithful.
We now construct this left adjoint directly, but delay the proof of the adjunction.
Analogously to the construction of the fundamental groupoid $\pi_{\leq 1}(X)$ of a topological space $X$, we can construct the homotopy category $\h\C$ of an $\infty$-category $\C$.
\prepp{Writing about the fundamental gruopoid could be smart.}
\begin{definition}
    Let $\C$ be an $\infty$-category.
    We denote by $\Hom_{\h\C}(X,Y)$ homotopy classes of morphisms $X\to Y \in \C$ and for a morphism $f \in \Hom_{\C}(X,Y)$, we denote by $[f]$ its equivalence class in $\Hom_{\h\C}(X,Y)$.
\end{definition}
\begin{proposition}
    We have a unique composition of morphisms
    \[
        \circ : \Hom_{\h\C}(Y, Z) \times \Hom_{\h\C}(X, Y) \rightarrow \Hom_{\h\C}(X, Z)
    \]
    such that $[h] = [f] \circ [g]$ for any $h = f\circ g \in \C$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    This follows directly from the previous two propositions.
\end{proof}
