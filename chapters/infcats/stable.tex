\section{Stable $\infty$-categories}
\begin{definition}
    A zero-object, usually denoted $0$, in an $\infty$-category is an object that is both initial and terminal.
    A pointed $\infty$-category is an $\infty$-category containing a zero-object.
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
    An object $0\in \C$ is a zero-object if $\MAP_{\C}(X,0)$ and $\MAP_{\C}(0,X)$ are contractible for every object $X\in \C$ and such an object is determined up to equivalence.
\end{remark}
\TODO{Define contractibility earlier.}
