    \begin{definition}\cite[Definition 4.1.1.1]{HTT}
        Let \(S\xrightarrow{p}T \in \sset \). $p$ is \emph{cofinal} if, for any right fibration $X\to T$, the induced map of simplicial sets
            \[
              \MAP_T(T,X) \to \MAP_T(S,X)  
            \]
        is a homotopy equivalence.
    \end{definition}
    We will probably want to write more about cofinality later, but for now we state a result that will be extremely helpful later.
    \begin{thm}\cite[Theorem 4.1.3.1]{HTT}
        Let \(f: \C \to \D\) be a map of simplicial sets, where $\D$ is an $\infty$-category.
        Then the following conditions are equivalent:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item The functor $f$ is cofinal.
            \item For every $D\in \D$, the simplicial set $\C\times_\D \D_{D/}$ is weakly contractible.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{thm}
