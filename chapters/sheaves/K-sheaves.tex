The origins of sheaf theory is quite a remarkable story, and we quote Armand Borel \cite{Borel}:
\begin{quotation}
    ``The Second World War broke out in 1939 and J. Leray [then Professor at the Sorbonne and an officer in the French army] was made prisoner by the Germans in 1940.
    He spent the next five years in captivity in an officers’ camp, Oflag XVIIA in Austria [not far from Salzburg].
    With the help of some colleagues, he founded a university there, of which he became the Director (“recteur”).
    His major mathematical interests had been so far in analysis, on a variety of problems which, though theoretical, had their origins in, and potential applications to, technical problems in mechanics or fluid dynamics.
    Algebraic topology had been only a minor interest, geared to applications to analysis. Leray feared that if his competence as a “mechanic” (“mécanicien,” his word) were known to the German authorities in the camp, he might be compelled to work for the German war machine, so he converted his minor interest to his major one, in fact to his essentially unique one, presented himself as a pure mathematician, and devoted himself mainly to algebraic topology.''
\end{quotation}
Originally, Leray defined sheaves as a functor from closed subspaces, and it was Cartan that reformulated the theory using open subspaces.\cite{H.Miller}
His first example was the sheaf assigning a topological space its $p$th cohomology group.

\section{Sheaves on topological spaces}
We will closely follow Lurie \cite{HTT}.
Let $\Open(X)$ denote the partial order of open subsets of a topological space $X$.
\TODO{Define covering sieves.}
\begin{definition}[{\cite[Definition 6.2.2.1.]{HTT}}]
    Let $\C$ be an $\infty$-category.
    We define a sieve on $\C$ to be a full subcategory $\C^{(0)} \subseteq \C$ such that for any morphism $f \in \Hom_{\C}(X,Y)$ where $Y\in C^{(0)}$, $X$ must also belong to $C^{(0)}$.
    Furthermore, for an object $X \in \C$, we define a sieve on $X$ to be a sieve on $\C_{/X}$ in the above sense.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[{\cite[Definition 6.2.2.1.]{HTT}}]
    We define a Grothendieck topology on an $\infty$-category $\C$ as a collection of sieves called covering sieves on every object $X\in \C$.
    These collections are required to satisfy the following conditions:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item For an object $X\in \C$, the sieve $\C_{/X} \subseteq \C_{/X}$ is a covering sieve.
        \item For a morphism $f \in \Hom_{\C}(X,Y)$ and covering sieve $\C^{(0)}_{/X}$ on $Y$, $f^*\C^{(0)}_{/X}$ is a covering sieve on $X$.
        \item For an object $X \in \C$, a covering sieve $\C^{(0)}_{/X}$ on $X$, and an arbitrary  $\C^{(1)}_{/X}$ sieve on $X$, if the pullback $f^*\C^{(1)}_{/X}$ is a covering sieve on $Y$ for any $f: X \to Y$, then $\C^{(1)}_{/X}$ is a covering sieve on $X$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[{\cite[Definition 7.3.3.1]{HTT}}]\label{sheaf_on_top}
    Let $X \in \mathrm{Top}$ and $\C$ an $\infty$-category.
    We define a $\C$-valued sheaf on $X$ to be a presheaf $\F: \Open(X)^{op} \to \C$ such that for every $U\subseteq X$ and every covering sieve $\mathscr{W} \subseteq \Open(X)_{/U}$, the diagram
    \[
        \Nerve(\mathscr{W})^{\triangleright} \hookrightarrow \Nerve(\Open(X)_{/U})^{\triangleright} \rightarrow \Nerve(\Open(X))\xrightarrow{\F}\C^{op}
    \]
    is a colimit.
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
    We will often utilize the fact that this is equivalent to the following limit diagram:
    \[
        \Nerve((\mathscr{W})^{op})^{\triangleleft} \hookrightarrow \Nerve((\Open(X)_{/U})^{op})^{\triangleleft} \rightarrow \Nerve(\Open(X))^{op}\xrightarrow{\F}\C
    \]
\end{remark}

\TODO{Mention the ``normal definitions using covers and Cech nerves and briefly discuss relation to classical definition of sheaves in a $1$-category.}
We write $\Presh(X, \C)$ for the $\infty$-category $\mathrm{Fun}(\Open(X)^{op}, \C)$ of $\C$-valued presheaves on $X$ and $\Shv(X;\C)$ for the full subcategory of $\Presh(X;\C)$ spanned by the $\C$-valued sheaves on $X$.
Whenever we write $\Shv(X)$ without specifying the target category $\C$, we will always mean sheaves valued in spaces, i.e. $\Shv(X;\Spaces)$.
\TODO{Make sure $\Spaces$ is introduced in chapter on stable infcats.}
\section{Sheaves on locally compact spaces}
In this section we will show that for locally compact Hausdorff spaces there is an equivalence of $\infty$-categories between $\Shv(X;\C)$ and $\KShv(X;\C)$ where the latter denote so-called $\K$-sheaves and $\C$ is a presentable $\infty$-category with left exact filtered colimits.
These are sheaves defined on the collection of compact subsets instead of the opens.
Classically it is known that sheaves of sets on such spaces are determined by compact subsets as well as the opens.
\TODO{Expand on this with references.}
\begin{definition}
    For a locally compact Hausdorff space $X$, we write $\K(X)$ for its collection of compact subsets.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
    If $K, K' \subseteq X$, we write $K \Subset K'$ if there exists an open subset $U\subseteq X$ between $K$ and $K'$, i.e. $K \subseteq U \subseteq K'$.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
    If $K\subseteq X$ is compact, we write $\K_{K\Subset}(X)$ for the set $\{ K'\in \K(X) | K \Subset K' \}$ which gives a poset category $\K(X)$.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
    A presheaf $\F:\Nerve(\K(X))^{op}\to \C$ is a $\K$-sheaf if it satisfies the following:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\F(\emptyset)$ is terminal.
        \item For every pair $K,K'\in \K(X)$, the diagram
              \[\begin{tikzcd}
                      {\F(K \cup K')} && {\F(K)} \\
                      \\
                      {\F(K')} && {\F(K\cap K')}
                      \arrow[from=1-3, to=3-3]
                      \arrow[from=3-1, to=3-3]
                      \arrow[from=1-1, to=3-1]
                      \arrow["\lrcorner"{anchor=center, pos=0.125}, draw=none, from=1-1, to=3-3]
                      \arrow[from=1-1, to=1-3]
                  \end{tikzcd}\]
              is a pullback in $\C$.
        \item For each $K\in \K(X)$, $\F(K)$ is a colimit of $\F|\Nerve(\K_{K\Subset}(X))^{op}$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
    We denote the full subcategory of $\Presh(\Nerve(\K(X)); \C)$ spanned by the $\K$-sheaves by $\KShv(X;\C)$.
\end{definition}
\begin{lemma}[{\cite[][Lemma 7.3.4.8]{HTT}}]\label{7.3.4.8}
    Let $X$ be locally compact and Hausdorff, and let $\C$ be a presentable $\infty$-category with left exact filtered colimits.
    Let $\W$ be an open cover of $X$ and denote by $\K_{\W}(X)$ the compact subsets of $X$ that are contained in some element of $\W$.
    Any $\K$-sheaf $\F\in \KShv(X;\C)$ is a right Kan extension of $\F|\Nerve(\K_{\W}(X))^{op}$.
\end{lemma}

    \TODO{Proof is in HTT.}
