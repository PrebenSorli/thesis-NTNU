    In 1965, Jean-Louis Verdier introduced Verdier duality for locally compact topological spaces, thus generalizing the classical theory of Poincaré duality for manifolds.
    Verdier Duality is a cohomological duality allowing exchanging cohomology for cohomology with compact support.
    More precisely it states that the derived functor of the compactly supported direct image functor has a right adjoint in the derived category of sheaves.
    By using sheaf cohomology one can derive the classical Poincaré duality as a special case.
    In his book ``Higher Algebra'' Jacob Lurie extends the theory to the $\infty$-categorical setting by showing there is an equivalence between sheaves and cosheaves valued in stable $\infty$-categories.
    This thesis follows this proof closely, expanding and adding details where necesarry.
    To introduce the relevant background on sheaves and $\K$-sheaves valued in stable $\infty$-categories we introduce and utilize Kan extensions, a ubiquitous concept in category theory as well as giving an expository account of the basic theory of $\infty$-categories.
